    <string name="dialog_explain_permissions">This app needs Device Administrator permissions in order to disable the use of the fingerprint on the lockscreen and for wiping the device after too many incorrect device-unlock password. Nothing else is done with this permission. Sadly I don\'t know how to request only the necessary permissions for the current selected options - that why I request all three Device Administrator permissions at one.
